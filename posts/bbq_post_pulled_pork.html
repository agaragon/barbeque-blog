            <h2>ü•© Selecting Your Pork Shoulder</h2>
            <p>Pulled pork starts with choosing the right cut. You want a bone-in pork shoulder (also called Boston butt or pork butt), weighing 8-10 pounds. The bone adds flavor and helps retain moisture during the long cook.</p>
            
            <h3>What to Look For:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Marbling:</strong> Good fat distribution throughout</li>
                <li><strong>Size:</strong> 8-10 pounds for optimal cook time</li>
                <li><strong>Color:</strong> Pink-red meat, avoid gray or brown areas</li>
                <li><strong>Fat cap:</strong> Some exterior fat is good, but trim excess</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>üßÇ The Perfect Pork Rub</h2>
            <p>A good rub penetrates the meat and forms a beautiful bark during cooking. Apply it at least 2 hours before cooking, but overnight is even better.</p>
            
            <h3>Championship Pork Rub:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cumin</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Mix thoroughly and apply generously to all surfaces of the pork shoulder. The sugar will help create a beautiful mahogany bark.</p>

            <h2>üî• The Low and Slow Process</h2>
            <p>Pork shoulder is incredibly forgiving, making it perfect for beginners. The high fat and connective tissue content means it's hard to overcook.</p>
            
            <h3>Smoking Timeline:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> 225-250¬∞F throughout</li>
                <li><strong>Time:</strong> 1.5-2 hours per pound</li>
                <li><strong>Target temp:</strong> 203-205¬∞F internal</li>
                <li><strong>Rest time:</strong> 1-2 hours wrapped in towels</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>üå°Ô∏è The Stall and How to Handle It</h2>
            <p>Around 160-170¬∞F, your pork will hit "the stall" - where internal temperature plateaus for hours. This is normal! Moisture evaporation creates cooling that balances the heat input.</p>
            
            <h3>Stall Management Options:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wait it out:</strong> Be patient, it will eventually push through</li>
                <li><strong>Texas Crutch:</strong> Wrap in foil with some liquid</li>
                <li><strong>Butcher paper:</strong> Wrap for faster cooking while maintaining bark</li>
                <li><strong>Increase heat:</strong> Bump temperature to 275¬∞F</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>üåØ Wrapping Techniques</h2>
            <p>Wrapping can help power through the stall while keeping meat moist. Each method has its benefits:</p>
            
            <h3>Foil Wrapping (Texas Crutch):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Creates steam for faster cooking</li>
                <li>Keeps meat very moist</li>
                <li>Can soften bark significantly</li>
                <li>Add butter, brown sugar, or apple juice</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Butcher Paper Wrapping:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Breathes better than foil</li>
                <li>Maintains better bark texture</li>
                <li>Still speeds up cooking</li>
                <li>More authentic BBQ competition style</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>üéØ Testing for Doneness</h2>
            <p>Temperature is important, but texture tells the real story with pulled pork:</p>
            
            <h3>Doneness Tests:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Probe test:</strong> Thermometer should slide in like butter</li>
                <li><strong>Bone wiggle:</strong> Bone should wiggle freely in the meat</li>
                <li><strong>Fork test:</strong> Fork should twist easily in the meat</li>
                <li><strong>Internal temp:</strong> 203-205¬∞F for optimal pulling</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>‚úã The Crucial Rest Period</h2>
            <p>Don't skip the rest! This allows juices to redistribute and the meat to finish cooking with residual heat. Wrap in towels and place in a cooler for 1-2 hours.</p>

            <h2>üç¥ Pulling and Serving</h2>
            <p>Remove the bone and any large fat chunks, then start pulling. Use two forks, meat claws, or clean hands (with gloves) to shred the meat along the grain.</p>
            
            <h3>Pulling Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pull while warm for easier shredding</li>
                <li>Save the cooking juices for moisture</li>
                <li>Remove excess fat as you pull</li>
                <li>Mix bark pieces throughout for flavor</li>
                <li>Season lightly with reserved rub if needed</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Under-seasoning:</strong> Large cuts need generous seasoning</li>
                <li><strong>Overcooking:</strong> Even forgiving pork can be overdone</li>
                <li><strong>Poor timing:</strong> Allow extra time, you can always hold it warm</li>
